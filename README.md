## Culturelle

This is my last project for my Udacity Android Nanodegree. In this project i utilized all the concepts that i learned during my studies to 
create an app that is geared towards users who are addicted to current events. 

The NewsApi.org was used to create a vibrant Live News Feed UI that delivers Gossip, News, Games and Tech information in a very Efficient
and User Friendly manner. I used content provider for persistent data and Sync Adapter to update the data on the wedget continously 
and A Loader Manager to update the UI.

I learned a great deal while developing this application, this is one of my first projects of my own, so, it was interesting discovering how to 
planned out an app and analyze ways that different tasks were going to be performed. I expect that this learning experience while enhance my
ability to continuous improve from here.
